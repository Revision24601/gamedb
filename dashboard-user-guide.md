# GameDB Dashboard User Guide

## Introduction

The GameDB Dashboard gives you visual insights into your gaming collection. It shows you which games you're currently playing and how many hours you've invested in each one, along with helpful statistics about your entire collection.

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. Log in to your GameDB account
2. Click on the "Dashboard" link in the navigation bar at the top of the page
3. You'll be taken to the dashboard page where you can see your stats and currently playing games

## Dashboard Features

### Collection Statistics

At the top of the dashboard, you'll see four statistics cards:

- **Total Games**: The total number of games in your collection
- **Completed**: How many games you've marked as completed
- **Avg Rating**: The average rating you've given to all your games
- **Hours Playing**: The total hours you've spent on games currently being played

### Platform Insights

Below the statistics, you'll see an insight about your most played platform, showing which platform (e.g., PC, PlayStation, Xbox) you use most frequently.

### Currently Playing Games Chart

The main chart shows your games with "Playing" status:

- Each bar represents a game you're currently playing
- The height/length of the bar shows how many hours you've played
- Hover over a bar to see the full game title and exact hours
- Click on any bar to go directly to that game's detail page
- Only the top 15 games (by hours played) are shown

### Playing Games List

Below the chart is a table that shows the same information in a list format:

- Game title (clickable to view details)
- Platform
- Hours played

This view can be especially helpful on mobile devices or when you want to compare hours precisely.

## Empty State

If you don't have any games with "Playing" status:

- You'll see a friendly message letting you know no games are currently being played
- A button to "Add Your First Game" will take you directly to the add game form
- Set a game's status to "Playing" to see it appear on the dashboard

## Tips for Using the Dashboard

1. **Track Your Time**: Remember to update the hours played for your games to keep the dashboard accurate
2. **Set Correct Status**: Only games with the "Playing" status appear on the chart
3. **Mobile View**: On smaller screens, the bars will appear horizontally for better visibility
4. **Sorting**: Games are automatically sorted by hours played (highest first)
5. **Navigation**: Use the dashboard as a quick way to jump to your most-played games

## Troubleshooting

- **Game not appearing on dashboard?** Check that its status is set to "Playing"
- **Hours not updating?** Make sure you've saved changes after updating a game's hours
- **Chart looks empty?** You might need to add hours to your playing games
