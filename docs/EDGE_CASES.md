# GameDB Edge Cases

This document outlines important edge cases to test in the GameDB application to ensure robustness and reliability.

## API Edge Cases

### Game Creation

- **Empty Required Fields**: Attempt to create a game with empty title or platform
- **Very Long Input**: Test with extremely long strings for title, platform, and notes fields
- **Special Characters**: Test with titles and platforms containing special characters and emojis
- **Duplicate Titles**: Attempt to create games with identical titles
- **Negative Values**: Try setting negative values for rating and hoursPlayed
- **Rating Out of Range**: Try setting ratings below 0 or above 10
- **Invalid Status**: Attempt to set a status that's not in the enum
- **Invalid Image URLs**: Test with malformed URLs for imageUrl

### Game Retrieval

- **Non-existent ID**: Request a game with an ID that doesn't exist
- **Malformed ID**: Use an invalid format for the game ID
- **Special Characters in Search**: Search with special characters and SQL/NoSQL injection attempts
- **Empty Search Results**: Search with terms that should yield no results
- **Large Result Sets**: Test pagination with a large number of games
- **Multiple Filter Combinations**: Test various combinations of filters and sort options

### Game Updates

- **Concurrent Updates**: Simulate multiple users updating the same game simultaneously
- **Partial Updates**: Test updating only specific fields while leaving others unchanged
- **Invalid Updates**: Attempt to update a game with invalid data
- **Update Non-existent Game**: Try to update a game that doesn't exist

### Game Deletion

- **Delete Non-existent Game**: Attempt to delete a game that doesn't exist
- **Delete Already Deleted Game**: Try to delete a game twice
- **Bulk Deletion**: Test performance with bulk deletion operations

## UI Edge Cases

### Form Handling

- **Empty Form Submission**: Submit forms without filling required fields
- **Form Validation**: Test all validation rules in the UI
- **Form Reset**: Test clearing forms and resetting to initial state
- **Auto-save Functionality**: If implemented, test auto-save behavior during form editing

### Game Display

- **Missing Images**: Display of games with missing or broken image links
- **Long Text Overflow**: Test display of very long titles, platforms, or notes
- **Zero State**: UI behavior when no games exist in the database
- **Large Collection Performance**: Test performance with a large number of games

### Search and Filtering

- **Special Characters**: Search with special characters, emojis, and escape sequences
- **Empty Search Results**: UI behavior when search yields no results
- **Search with Multiple Terms**: Test combining multiple search terms
- **Filter Combinations**: Test all possible combinations of filters

### Responsiveness

- **Mobile Views**: Test on various mobile screen sizes
- **Tablet Views**: Test on tablet screen sizes
- **Desktop Views**: Test on different desktop screen sizes
- **Device Orientation**: Test landscape and portrait modes

## Authentication/Authorization (If Implemented)

- **Invalid Credentials**: Attempt login with invalid credentials
- **Session Timeout**: Test behavior when sessions expire
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Test multiple simultaneous logins
- **Permission Boundaries**: Test access to resources without proper permissions

## Performance Edge Cases

- **Large Database**: Test with a large number of games (1000+)
- **Slow Network**: Test behavior under slow network conditions
- **Server Latency**: Test behavior with increased server response times
- **Memory Constraints**: Test on devices with limited memory

## Security Edge Cases

- **SQL/NoSQL Injection**: Test input fields with injection attempts
- **XSS Vulnerabilities**: Test with script tags in input fields
- **CSRF Attacks**: Test cross-site request forgery protection
- **Rate Limiting**: Test behavior under excessive request rates

## Plan for Testing

1. **Automated Tests**: Implement unit and integration tests for API edge cases
2. **Manual Testing**: Conduct manual testing for UI edge cases
3. **Load Testing**: Use tools to simulate high load scenarios
4. **Security Testing**: Use security scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities
